                From the Myersâ€“Briggs Personality Test, I am a Sigma INTJ, supposedly very rare. I do strive to live in a
                constant state of learning, from politics, science, religion, art, history, and philosophy, to the more
                mundane tasks of cooking, gardening and home repair hacks. I navigate life with a clear moral compass,
                and strong intuition. I drink from life with a glass half-full perspective, and I always pursue a better
                tomorrow for all.
