            From the Myersâ€“Briggs Personality Test, I am a Sigma INTJ, supposedly very rare. I do strive to live in a
            constant state of learning, from politics, science, religion, art, history, and philosophy, to the more
            mundane tasks of cooking, gardening and home repair hacks. I navigate life with a clear moral compass,
            and strong intuition. I drink from life with a glass half-full perspective, and I always pursue a better
            tomorrow for all.
